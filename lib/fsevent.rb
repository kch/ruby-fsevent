  # It takes zero or more _directory_ arguments, which can be either a single
  # path or an array of paths. Each directory and all its sub-directories will
  # be monitored for file system modifications. The exact directory where the
  # event occurred will be passed to the user when the +changes+ method is
  # called.
  #
  # Clients can supply a Numeric _latency_ parameter as last argument, which
  # tells how long to wait after an event occurs before notifying; this
  # reduces the volume of events and reduces the chance that the client will
  # see an "intermediate" state.
